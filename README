This is a text-based rpg videogame of which I created in High School. It had a semi-working transaction system and a gambling system based off of the card game "blackjack".

I started working on it from April 2020 until my freshman year of college in September 2021. In order to run the game, Run "EconomyAppv2.java".

This is the project which initially peaked my interest into pursuing Computer Science.
